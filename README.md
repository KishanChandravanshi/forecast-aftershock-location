# forecast-aftershock-location
The model will use deep learning techniques to predict the aftershock locations and there severity. I'll be taking the data provided by the SRCMOD http://equake-rc.info/SRCMOD/
Previously we have been using the coulomb's stress criterion to explain the spatial distributions of aftershocks, but as the advent of technology is rising, it is highly possible that these machine learning models can find a undiscovered pattern that can be helpful in prediciting the fair locations of aftershocks. The data provided by the SCRMOD contains the information about the hypocenter, latitude, longitude, magnitude, strike, dip and most importantly the inversion parameters and many other relevant data that is sufficient to get an insight of the earthquake and the probable location of the aftershocks.
By feeding these data to the deep neural network along with relevant preprocessing we can get a fairly good model predicting the severity as well as the location of aftershocks, which can be used by the officials to deploy the troops as required.
